RIZzo
------------------
Tools to interact with RIZzo, a library that contains far-red optical (~6,000-10,000 Å) spectra for ultracool objects (low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and giants) covering the R, I and Z bands in the visible, from a variety of references.

This research has benefitted from the Ultracool [RIZzo Spectral Library](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11313), maintained by Jonathan Gagné (@jonathangagne) and Kelle Cruz.
